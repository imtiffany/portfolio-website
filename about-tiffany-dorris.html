            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>Thank you for viewing my portfolio, allow me to introduce myself. 
                My name is Tiffany and I am a UI designer located in the Chicago, Illinois. It has been a passion of mine to design for as long as I could remember, however, the journey it took to realize this was not the most straightforward process.
            </p>
            <p>Design first peaked my interest in college when I would design flyers for events being held around campus. What started off as a few, here and there, quickly turned in to dozens as request for my services increased. Unfortunately, I was in school for medicine and designing flyerâ€™s wasn't apart of my curriculum, so my journey with design would have to pause there. However, even though I stuck with my major, I did make a mental note of the joy I had when I would be working on designs. 
            </p>
            <p>Fast forward to today, here I am deciding that it is never too late to chase a new dream. The journey may have had a few pit stops but a long the way it gave me the passion and drive it takes to create unique UI designs that are special and inclusive to all. 
            </p>
